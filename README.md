Description:
This app is called Dive Finder. You land on the start page with a button that links to 10 question survey. You answer the questions about various bar preferences on a scale of 1-5, with ! being "Disagree" and 5 being "Agree." After filling out the survey the app will return the bar that best matches your preferences.

CODE SNIPPET:
This section of the code takes in users survey responses and compares the difference between current user's scores against the scores from each bar. One thing to note is we are comparing the absolute value of the differences so we don't get bad data with negative numbers.




Because I attempted to make a variation of the basic app instructions (matching users with a bar rather than other users) I had some trouble making sure the logic would still work properly.

Another issue with my concept was that a lot of bars have a lot of overlapping critera scores so I had to try to choose, and score the bars in such a way that users would not match with more than one bar at a time.

Take Away:
I enjoyed playing with the concept of this app, as I have some specific projects on the horizon that will incorporate a similar form of survey that returns a match from a larger database. 

While it is important to understand exactly what each portion of code does and why it does it, it is also important to embrace the many libraries, packages and technologies that exist to make your coding easier to not only write but also read.
